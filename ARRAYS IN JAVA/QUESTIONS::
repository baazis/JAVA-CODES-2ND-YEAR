1- Write a java Program to display the sum of rows in a matrix
2- Write a java Program to display the addition of two matrix
3- Write a java Program to display the transpose of a matrix
4- Write a Java program to sort an array of positive integers of an given array,
   in the sorted array the value of the first element should be maximum, second
   value should be minimum value, third should be second maximum, fourth second
   be second minimum and so on.
5- Write a Java program to separate even and odd numbers of an given array of
   integers. Put all even numbers first, and then odd numbers.
6- Write a Java program to remove the duplicate elements of a given array and
   return the new length of the array.
7- Write a Java program to find the sum of the two elements of a given array
   which is equal to a given integer.
8- Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in
    multidimensional arrays and looping constructs. Eg., If there are 4 batches in
    BTech - “CSE1007” course, read the count of the slow learners (who have scored
    <25) in each batch. Tutors should be assigned in the ratio of 1:4 (For every 4 slow
    learners, there should be one tutor). Determine the number of tutors for each
    batch. Create a 2- D jagged array with 4 rows to store the count of slow learners
    in the 4 batches. The number of columns in each row should be equal to the
    number of groups formed for that particular batch ( Eg., If there are 23 slow
    learners in a batch, then there should be 6 tutors and in the jagged array, the
    corresponding row should store 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,3). Use for-each loop to traverse the
    array and print the details. Also print the number of batches in which all tutors
    have exactly 4 students.
